    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Lawrence Dioka. I specialize in Google Workspace automation,
      building systems using Google Sheets, Google Forms, and Google Apps Script
      to eliminate manual work and improve productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I design workflow automation solutions such as KPI logging systems,
      automated reporting dashboards, form-to-sheet workflows, and trigger-based
      processes that run independently in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mentored in automation development at Soak Sentinel Lab,
      where I strengthened my expertise in building scalable and efficient
      cloud-based automation systems.
