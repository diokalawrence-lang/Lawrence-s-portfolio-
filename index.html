  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Lawrence Dioka. I specialize in Google Workspace automation,
    building systems using Google Sheets, Google Forms, and Google Apps Script
    to eliminate manual work and improve productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    I design workflow automation solutions such as KPI logging systems,
    automated reporting dashboards, form-to-sheet workflows, and trigger-based
    processes that run independently in the cloud.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was mentored in automation development at Soak Sentinel Lab,
    where I strengthened my expertise in building scalable and efficient
    cloud-based automation systems.
