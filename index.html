    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Lawrence Dioka. I specialize in Google Workspace automation,
      building systems using Google Sheets, Google Forms, and Google Apps Script
      to eliminate manual work and improve productivity.
    </p>
    <p
      I design workflow automation solutions such as KPI logging systems,
      automated reporting dashboards, form-to-sheet workflows, and trigger-based
      processes that run independently in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was mentored in automation development at Soak Sentinel Lab,
      where I strengthened my expertise in building scalable and efficient
      cloud-based automation systems.

    <h3>Automated Daily Marketing KPI Logger</h3>
    <p>
      
This project is a fully automated marketing reporting system built using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. 
It collects raw campaign data (Spend and Leads) from multiple platforms and automatically generates a daily KPI summary without manual input.
</p>

<p>
The automation runs on time-driven triggers, calculates key performance metrics such as Total Spend, Total Leads, and Cost Per Lead, 
and logs the results into a Daily Summary sheet. This eliminates repetitive manual reporting tasks and ensures accurate, real-time performance tracking.
</p>
      
    

    <ul>
      <li>Reads Spend and Leads from Marketing Data sheet</li>
      <li>Calculates Total Spend & Total Leads</li>
      <li>Computes Cost Per Lead</li>
      <li>Appends results automatically to Daily Summary</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, Time-driven Triggers</p>
